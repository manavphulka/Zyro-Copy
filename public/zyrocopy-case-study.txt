How we helped kenny in her english coaching business

The Problem
Kenny was a highly skilled English-speaking coach, delivering real transformation to her students, 
but she struggled to turn attention into clients.
Her content was helpful, but her messaging lacked clarity and emotional pull. She was attracting interest, but not 
converting high-ticket leads, and international clients were barely trickling in. There was no consistent email 
strategy, and warm leads weren't being nurtured effectively. 
The result? Missed revenue, inconsistent bookings, and low conversion from her traffic.
